# rawdata

This is a pretty simply written tool that takes any file uploaded to it, no matter the type or size of file, and plays the bytes back as audio while also visualizing them as video data. <br>

If you've ever seen any videos on your YT feed that are titled something like "(game) as raw data" with a ton of computer beeping noises and colorful lights (I'm sure you've seen at least one, these are pretty popular), they used the same technique this does (albeit using a special FFmpeg command instead of this site). <br>

WARNING: Flashing lights are to be expected when using this program. If you're epileptic or just don't like flashing lights, turn off the visualizer using the button below the playback. <br>
